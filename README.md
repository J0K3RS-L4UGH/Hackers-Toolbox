3. To install all the required packages, use the commands ```cd Hackers-Toolbox``` ```chmod +x install.sh```, then run ```./install.sh```
4. To run, paste ```python3 HackersToolbox.py``` into the CLI
5. (Optional): edit run.cpp so the path in line 4 is the path to the ```HackersToolbox.py``` file in the cloned directory. Then run ```g++ run.cpp -o RunHackersToolbox``` and ```mv RunHackersToolbox /bin```
